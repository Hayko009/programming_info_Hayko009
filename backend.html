                        <h3>JavaScript is one of the most trustworthy backend programming languages. Coders use this language for both server-side and front-end tasks.
        
                            This backend language was initially launched 25 years back in 1995 and usually denoted as ‘JS’. Withal, you shouldn’t mix it with Java because both Java and JavaScript are completely different languages.
                            
                            JavaScript offers many advantages, including rich interfaces, online availability of numerous resources and Interoperability. Moreover, it is also considered one of the most popular programming languages.
                            
                            Undoubtedly, 69.7% of professional developers said they are using JavaScript for their projects, according to the 2020 Developer Survey of Stack Overflow. JS is holding this top position for the last 8 years in a row.</h3>
